# N-DOF Solver
N-DOF is a light-weight program designed to solve the angles required for inverse kinematics of an arbitrary system with N degrees of freedom using gradient descent. No built-in C++ libararies are used so it should work with any microcontroller that can load C++. Examples on how to use the software can be found in the "Examples" folder.
